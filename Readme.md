[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsumners/alfred-emoji.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsumners/alfred-emoji)

An [Alfred workflow][alfred] that makes it easy to search for emoji and copy
them to the clipboard 🤘.

> ## Note About Available Emoji
>
> The workflow is built against the latest available macOS within the GitHub
> continuous integration infrastructure. This means some emoji may be missing
> until the GitHub infrastructure is updated. It also means that some emoji
> may be present in the workflow that do not exist on your system if your
> system is running an earlier version of macOS.
>
> If this is not desired, follow the instructions below for generating the
> workflow on your own system.

## Installing the Workflow

[Download the provided Alfred workflow][releases].

Notice: This workflow relies on JXA (JavaScript for Automation) that is built
into macOS.

## Usage

```
emoji [query]
```

Press <kbd>return</kbd> (↵): **Copy the symbol** of the selected emoji (e.g. 🤣) to
your clipboard.

Press <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> (⌥↵): **Copy the code** of the selected emoji)
(e.g. `:rofl:`) to your clipboard.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> (⌃↵): **Copy the codepoint** **of** the selected emoji)
(e.g. `U+1F923`) to your clipboard.

Press <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> (⇧↵): **Copy the default symbol** of the selected emoji)
(e.g. 🤣) to your clipboard without skin tone modifier.

Press <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> (⌘↵): **Paste the symbol** of the selected
emoji (e.g. 🤣) directly to your frontmost application.

### Set skin tone

To change the emoji skin tone for supported emoji set the `skin_tone` environment variable in Alfred:

![screenshot skin tone settings](images/screenshot-skin-tone-setting.png)

Options:
- No value => 👍
- `0` => 👍🏻
- `1` => 👍🏼
- `2` => 👍🏽
- `3` => 👍🏾
- `4` => 👍🏿
- `random` => 👍🏻 | 👍🏼 | 👍🏽 | 👍🏾 | 👍🏿

After setting skin tone you can still quickly copy the default emoji with the <kbd>shift</kbd> modifier.

## Automatic Updates

This workflow will automatically check for updates at most once per day. If a
new release is found, it automatically downloads and installs the latest
version of the workflow. All downloads come directly from official [GitHub
releases][releases].

## Optional Hotkey and Snippet Triggers

Trigger the workflow with either a custom hotkey or a custom snippet.

## Building the Workflow

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`

Note: Node.js >= 20 is required.

## Loading the Workflow into Alfred

1. `npm run load`

## Inspiration

This is based on the original work by [Carlos Galdino][carlos]. His project
seems to be unmaintained (some emoji don't copy and some newer are missing).
Whereas his project is based on the Ruby language, this one is based on
JavaScript.
