# alfred-emoji

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsumners/alfred-emoji.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsumners/alfred-emoji)

This project builds an [Alfred workflow][alfred] that makes it easy to search
for emoji and copy them to the clipboard 🤘.

This is based on the original work by [Carlos Galdino][carlos]. His project
seems to be unmaintained (some emoji don't copy and some newer are missing).
Whereas his project is based on the Ruby language, this one is based on
JavaScript using [Node.js][node].

## Installing the Workflow

[Download the provided Alfred workflow][releases].

Notice: Alfred does not bundle the Node runtime, and neither does macOS.
Therefore, the workflow generated by this project downloads the latest LTS
release of Node and embeds it. You are welcome to build your own copy of this
workflow instead of trusting the [provided binary][releases].

releases][releases].
